      content: "The presentation on the direct use application of geothermal energy stood out to me. Coming from Kenya, a country rich in geothermal resources…. Our geothermal energy is primarily used for electricity generation in large power plants, but many neighbouring communities, often pastoral and without access to electricity, do not benefit directly from these resources. This innovative approach, which includes applications such as egg incubation, presents an opportunity to expand the direct use of geothermal energy in ways that can truly benefit these communities. For instance, small-scale geothermal projects could generate electricity for local use, offering an off-grid solution to connect remote communities. Additionally, geothermal energy could be harnessed to support greenhouse farming, which would help improve food security in these arid regions of the Rift Valley. This technology has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for these communities by providing suitable sustainable energy",

      content: "Attending the AICCEES conference profoundly shaped my understanding of my role in the clean energy sector and reaffirmed my career goals. With my background in economics, I often questioned my fit within the clean energy field, wondering if I should shift back to a more traditional economic focus. However, the insights gained from the conference clarified that I truly belong in clean energy. I realised that I don’t need to be an engineer or have a technical background in energy systems to make a meaningful impact in this critical sector. Clean energy is multifaceted, and my economics expertise positions me well to contribute… As my career has evolved, particularly through my work on electric cooking, off-grid energy access, and sustainability projects, I have become increasingly drawn to the intricate connections between economic development, clean energy access, climate change, environmental sustainability, and social inclusivity. This experience has solidified my commitment to focusing my career and academic pursuits on clean energy and inclusive, sustainable development",

      content: "The insights from the conference have provided me with a broader perspective on the role of sustainable energy in improving health outcomes, especially for vulnerable communities in Nigeria. First, I intend to apply the lessons learned to my ongoing research on energy poverty and its health implications, specifically by exploring cleaner energy alternatives for households and businesses. Second, I will use the professional relationships I established during the conference to foster collaborative projects, particularly those focused on bridging the gap between public health and energy access. This aligns with my long-term goal of contributing to policies that promote clean energy solutions to reduce environmental health risks. Finally, I plan to actively advocate for sustainable energy transitions in my role as a public health expert, using this platform to raise awareness about the health and socio-economic benefits of clean energy adoption.",
